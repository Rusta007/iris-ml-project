# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project is a simple Machine Learning classification model built using Python to classify **Iris flower species** based on the famous [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset contains **150 rows** with 4 feature columns:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

And **1 target** column:
- Species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Loads the dataset using `sklearn.datasets`
- Explores and visualizes the data using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Applies a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier
- Evaluates the model using accuracy score
- Predicts species based on new inputs

## 🧠 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

Install them (if not already):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


📈 Model Accuracy
The KNN model gives an accuracy of around 95-97%, depending on the train/test split.
